        <h2>Why you should just <i>"stop criticism"</i></h2>
        <p>Judging and criticizing anything and anyone seems to have become the most important activity for everyone who has a life on the internet, especially on social networks. Contrary to popular belief, criticizing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donna-labermeier/negative-impact-of-criticism-_b_3829346.html">is not helpful to others</a>: criticism simply <strong>exacerbates problems</strong> in relationships and the criticizer <strong>loses the respect</strong> of the criticized and even of those who are mere observers. This effect is even stronger online.</p>
        <p>Criticism is not helpful to anybody at all: it will not help the criticizer to be in a better place and it will not help the criticized to improve their behavior. It is a <u>lose-lose</u> situation. It is also a missed opportunity to improve themselves, others, and society as a whole.</p>
        <p>...And what if we <u>tried to improve</u> society?</p>

        <h2>What to do instead of criticizing</i></h2>

        <h4>1. Don’t criticize right away - put yourself in their shoes</i></h4>
        <p>Try to imagine what you would have done if you had been in their shoes and explain it. You will be perceived as someone who shares their own experiences and not as someone who likes criticizing for the sake of it. </p>

        <h4>2. Stop for a second and wonder whether you would’ve done the same thing</i></h4>
        <p>You can learn a lot from other people’s mistakes. Stop for a moment and wonder whether you would behave in the same way if you happened to find yourself in the same situation. You can learn from their mistakes as well as from their achievements! </p>

        <h4>3. Think about all the fu**ed up sh*t you have done in your life!</i></h4>
        <p>...and compare it to whatever the other person has done: were your actions worse? How did you behave in that situation? How did you feel when other people downed on you? Why would you want anyone else to feel that way?</p>

        <h4>4. Learn how to toughen up!</h4>
        <p>Avoiding criticism is a great way to learn some self-control and to gradually become more sympathetic toward others. It is also a useful way to recall that <i>"if you have nothing nice to say, you can always shut up."</i></p>

        <h4>5. Stop expecting too much from others!</h4>
        <p>Nobody is perfect and everybody’s learning curve has a different steepness: appreciate the good in the people that surround you and do not judge them for their lack of experience. Share what you know and what you have learnt from your own experiences, explaining why a given approach has failed in your case. In this way, those who read your posts or listen to your stories will respect and praise you more and more, and you will feel the gratitude of those treasuring your advice.</p>

        <h4>6. Offer to help instead of criticizing!</h4>
        <p> Any avoided criticism is an opportunity to help that person out: not only to help that person out in particular, but to improve society as a whole step by step...</p>

        <h2>And now criticize away :-) </i></h2>

        <p> Now that you have understood what kinds of behaviour do not improve the status quo, you can now distinguish between <em>destructive</em> criticism from  <em>constructive</em> criticism.</p>

        <h4>Constructive criticism</h4>

        <blockquote>
          <p>To give a person an opinion one must first judge well whether that person is of the disposition to receive it or not. One must become close with him and make sure that he continually trusts one's word. Approaching subjects that are dear to him, seek the best way to speak and to be well understood. Judge the occasion, and determine whether it is better by letter or at the time of leave-taking. </p>
          <p>Praise his good points and use every device to encourage him, perhaps by talking about one's own faults without touching on his, but so that they will occur to him. Have him receive this in the way that a man would drink water when his throat is dry, and it will be an opinion that will correct faults. </p>
          <p>This [TN: Constructive criticism] is extremely difficult.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Try to improve!</h2>

        <p>The line of thinking we have discussed here should not be confused or exploited as an excuse to not recognize one’s own mistakes and to reject constructive criticism.</p>

        <p>When you receive destructive criticism, you are facing a mistake made by the criticizer. You can then help the criticizer initiate a constructive discussion.</p>

        <p>If the one who is criticized is open to a discussion, he/she will will gain the criticizer’s respect.</p>
